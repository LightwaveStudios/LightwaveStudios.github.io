                Multiversal Monkeys started as an amusing joke but quickly became more destructive. Multiversal Monkeys had evolved overnight into what it is now. It is a powerful piece of music portraying monkeys that gather to party in their own universe, but the wild energy cannot be contained; this leads to a wave of mass destruction heading toward every galaxy.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                The production of Multiversal Monkeys felt unusually effortless. I had visions of an alternate reality where the world was at the mercy of monkeys. I captured everything I saw in this song. This song's nature now reflects the monkeys' characteristics: loud, wild, and out of control. Surprisingly, they still have a rhythm. The drum beat mixes riddim and house, with the clap often changing to a snare.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                The story is told from the perspective of a mysterious man observing the destruction of the monkeys from a distance (and has been for quite a while) as you are watching the chaos unleash right in front of you. You are in trouble as the unknown man tells you that nothing is certain (meaning he is unsure if you can escape alive). As the man says this, he appears to appreciate the chaos, as if it's a work of art.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                It is entirely possible that watching the monkeys go insane has placed a seed of madness inside of him, and by listening to Multiversal Monkeys, the same could happen to you.
